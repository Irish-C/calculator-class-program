# CALCULATOR CLASS
This is a simple calculator GUI built using Python's tkinter module. It allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

# Getting Started
## Installation
To get started, you'll need to have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your computer. <br/>
>**Note: This program might works only for windows os.**
<br/>

I used [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to create and run the program.

## Dependencies
To install the tkinter module, open up your terminal or command prompt and type:
```pip install tkinter```

# Usage
1. To use the calculator, select the mathematical operation you want to perform from the dropdown menu. 
2. Then enter the first and second numbers in the input fields and click the "Calculate" button. 
3. The result will be displayed in the result label below.
4. You can also clear the inputs and selection by clicking the "Clear" button.
